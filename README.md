# GPU Saver - Flandre
A fairly simple addon that optimizes the game when it is not active on the system, which saves computer resources and allows you to run more games besides Garry's mod. I also highly recommend to limit your frame rate to the frequency of your monitor, this will also reduce the workload and improve the game experience.

### ConVars:
- `cl_flandre_bgcolor` ( def. `"33 33 33"` ) - Standby screen background color.
- `cl_flandre_size` ( def. 25 ) [1-100] - Flandre size in percent.
